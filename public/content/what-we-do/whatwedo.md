# What We Do

AI2C accelerates AI integration across the U.S. Army by developing a world-class workforce and leading transformation-focused innovation using the following approaches.

**Workforce Development** : AI2C prioritizes building and expanding a technically capable workforce that is equipped to lead and support AI development across the Army.

*Deep Technical Talent Creation* : AI2C is committed to cultivating a highly skilled technical workforce, focusing on the creation of data scientists, data engineers, and AI cloud technicians. Personnel are provided with opportunities for hands-on experience in the latest AI and data-focused technologies, including machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and data engineering. AI2C facilitates this through dedicated self-development time, partnerships with academic institutions, and access to technical training programs. Graduates of the AI Scholars Program and AI Cloud Technician Program are key examples of this talent pipeline, ensuring that the Army remains at the forefront of AI innovation by growing expertise internally.

*Upskilling Leadership and Daily Users* : In addition to building deep technical expertise, AI2C focuses on upskilling Army leadership and the daily users of AI and data-centric products. This includes ensuring that
leaders at all levels understand how to leverage AI technologies in decision-making processes, and that end users can effectively interact with AI tools and products. Regular training sessions, workshops, and hands-on
demonstrations help bridge the gap between technology and its practical application in the field. By
empowering leaders and Soldiers with the knowledge to use AI tools effectively, AI2C fosters a culture of data driven decision-making across Army operations.

**Product Development** : The AI2C Incubator focuses on early-stage prototype development, creating Minimum Viable
Products (MVPs) that are designed to address real Army problems. These prototypes serve as proof-of-concept
solutions and are developed with the intention of transitioning them for continued maturation into
enterprise-level capabilities. Using an agile development methodology, incubator product teams work in short sprints to rapidly deliver functional prototypes that meet user needs while allowing for flexibility and adaptation.

Once the MVP is validated through user engagement and real-world experimentation, the product is handed off for
further development and scaling within larger Army or Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs. This
approach ensures that the incubator's innovations are not isolated efforts but are positioned for long-term success by
integrating them into the broader enterprise architecture. By focusing on scalable and transferable designs
from the start, the incubator ensures that its AI solutions can mature into robust, operational tools capable of meeting the Armyâ€™s long-term needs.

Additionally, the icubator maintains close collaboration with end-users throughout the development process, ensuring
that the prototypes align with mission requirements and operational constraints. This user-centered approach
allows for continuous feedback, refining the product for better usability and functionality as it moves toward fullscale
deployment.
