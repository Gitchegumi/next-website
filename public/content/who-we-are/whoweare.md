# Who We Are

The U.S. Army is entering a new era of continuous transformation oriented on three distinct timeframes. These timeframes are: <a href="https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Journals/Military-Review/Online-Exclusive/2024-OLE/Transformation-in-Contact/" target="_blank">24 months and less</a>; <a href="https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Journals/Military-Review/Online-Exclusive/2024-OLE/Deliberate-Transformation/" target="_blank">two to seven years</a>; and the <a href="https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Journals/Military-Review/Online-Exclusive/2024-OLE/Concept-Driven-Transformation/" target="_blank">deeper future</a>. Activities in these periods seek to provide capabilities needed now while generating capabilities for a future force. Transformation efforts focus on balancing long-term strategic planning with the ability to rapidly adapt to evolving operational demands. The Artificial Intelligence Integration Center (AI2C) plays a critical role in the Army’s transformation process. Our people and products lead the Army’s transformation process by providing technical skills, knowledge, and capabilities that allow leaders to quickly understand the operational environment and inform decision-making. We do this utilizing three lines of effort (LOEs) to support the U.S. Army’s transformation efforts: Workforce Development, AI Integration Activities, AI Product Development. AI2C focuses on accelerating the development of AI solutions that meet the needs of Army stakeholders delivering high-quality, scalable AI products at speed, tailored to specific user 
requirements and aligned with AFC command priorities.

# AFC Purpose

Transform the Army to ensure war-winning future readiness.

# AI2C Purpose

Accelerate AI integration across the U.S. Army by developing a world-class workforce and leading transformation-focused innovation.
