The program requires officers to serve a two-year follow-on utilization tour in the AI2C AI Factory, or at a location at the direction of the AI2C Director. The program provides selected officers opportunities for one of three graduate degree opportunities: Data Engineering, Data Analytics, or Autonomous System Engineering. AI2Câ€™s Academic Success Assessment will determine course discipline.",
